Source for my series on writing a compiler in Ruby.

See http://www.hokstad.com/compiler

**NOTE** This is still wildly incomplete. 



## Caveats

This section covers caveats about compiled Ruby vs. MRI, not
generally missing pieces or bugs in the current state of the
compiler (of which there are many).

### require

Presently, "require" is evaluated statically at compile time.

This makes certain Ruby patterns hard or impossible to support.
E.g. reading the contents of a directory and caling "require"
for each .rb file found will not presently work, and may never
work, as it is not clear in the context of compilation whether
or not the intent is to load this file at compile time or runtime.

Ruby allows the argument to "require" to be dynamically generated.
E.g. "require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/blah'". To facilitate
compatibility, limited forms of this pattern may eventually
be supported.

On MRI, "require" is generally overridden by a custom version
for rubygems or bundler. This is not likely to ever be
supported. "require" is likely to be treated as a keyword,
rather than as an overrideable method.


### $0

While `$0` will at some point be initialized with the name of
the file compilation is triggered for, certain patterns of
Ruby, such as conditionally executing code based on whether
a given file is executed directly are conceptually different,
given that $0 gets bound at *compile time*.

We'll need to consider if the right behaviour is for `$0` and/or
`__FILE__` to contain the equivalent of C's `argv[0]` instead.
Possibly make `$0` and `__FILE__` refer to different things.


### $:, $LOAD_PATH

The load path is malleable in MRI, and this is very frequently
used alongside certain methods to modify which files may be
loaded. Currently this is not supported.

It is likely that for compatibility a limited subset of Ruby
will be *interpreted* at compile time to support some forms
of this pattern. See also "require"
